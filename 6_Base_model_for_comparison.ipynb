    "We will also do a base model for comparison for the Bayesian latent AR process model. This model will be a regular sequential model, like an LSTM. For this model, we will use the extracted features and the corresponding densities. Something ot consider here is, we do get the extracted features from the previous exercise, however, did we also keep track of the corresponding densities? If we do not have the densities, we need to first get the densities, have them in a sequence, and then think about how best to fit the model. The base model may also have a encoder-decoder model? Or do we just use a dense neural network? "
